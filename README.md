# lineupGenerator

In order to use the lineup generator, you must create a .txt file that has your players in a list, each on a new line.

After their name, put a period and a 'm' if they are male, and 'f' if they are female. 

Then, open a curly bracket and list that players preferred positions in order, separated by a comma.

Here is an example:

Paden.m{SS,CF,1,2
Andrew.m{CF,R,1,2,SS
Trevor.m{CF,LF,RF,R
KyleP.m{1,RF,LF
Matt.m{2,1,SS,R
KyleG.m{2,SS,1
Brandon.m{RF,CF,LF,R
Scott.m{LF,2,RF,CF
Lauryn.f{BC,RF,LF,R
Toni.f{BC,R,3,RF,LF
Shannon.f{BC,3,2,RF,LF

In the app, open the file and a lineup will be generated.

You can change the number of innings in the HTML file.
